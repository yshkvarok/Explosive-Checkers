# Explosive-Checkers

> A Java based Checkers game running on StdDraw

The board is an 8x8 board, with water and fire pieces on the top and bottom. Each player starts with pieces in the three rows closest to them. The front, middle-most row consists of Bomb Pieces, the second row consists of Shield Pieces, and the back, edge-most row consists of normal pieces. Only every other space on the Board is used, and all pieces can only move and capture diagonally. If a capture move is available, the player is not required to capture. The bottom left corner should have a "black" square, and should contain a normal fire piece.

Movement of pieces are the same as classic Checkers. In all new games, fire team makes the first move. Besides king pieces, fire pieces always move upwards (like flames) and water pieces always move diagonally downwards (like rain). Upon reaching the topmost row, fire pieces become "kinged" and are allowed to move not only diagonally forwards, but also diagonally backwards. The same can be said for water pieces that reach the bottommost row. Capturing a piece works exactly the same as in classic Checkers. You may perform multi-captures like in classic Checkers.
